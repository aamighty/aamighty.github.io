title: Categorizing Reddit Posts Based on their Titles
---

### Objective:

The goal of this project is to use natural language processing to determine the subreddit based on the title of a post. The data includes all posts made to tech related subreddits in December 2016.

### Data Exploration
I took a look at the distribution of the number of posts by subreddit and noticed that the dataset is disproportionally _techsupport_ (we'll deal with that later).

Additionally, I noticed that a few of the subreddits are similar so I grouped them together.
