title: Categorizing Reddit Posts Based on their Titles
---

### Objective:
The goal of this project is to use natural language processing to determine the subreddit based on the title of a post. The data includes all posts made to tech related subreddits in December 2016.

### Data Exploration
I took a look at the distribution of the number of posts by subreddit and noticed that the dataset is disproportionally _techsupport_ (we'll deal with that later).

I grouped subreddits that have similar titles (ex: _pythoncoding_ and _Python_) and kept the nine subreddits with most observations.

### Data Modeling

Before we can evaluate whether our classifier's accuracy is good or bad, we need to know the **baseline accuracy**. The baseline accuracy is the proportion of the majority class. Baseline accuracy tells us the how often out model would be correct if it predicts that every observation belongs to the majority class. 

The baseline is calculated using:
$baseline = \frac{count of majority class}{total count}$

For this dataset the majority class is _techsupport_ and the baseline is 0.429.
